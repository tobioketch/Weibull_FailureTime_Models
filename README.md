##  README

This repository implements an adaptive Bayesian framework for modeling failure-time data using the Weibull distribution. The approach addresses key challenges in Bayesian Weibull analysis, such as non-conjugacy and multi-dimensional sufficient statistics, by employing a semi-parametric MCMC algorithm with the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) in STAN.
